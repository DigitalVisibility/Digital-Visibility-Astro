# SEO Evolution Presentation

This folder contains all the assets and instructions for the SEO Evolution PowerPoint presentation.

## How to Use These Files

1. Open the `presentation_outline.md` file for a detailed slide-by-slide structure
2. Create your PowerPoint presentation following these guidelines:
   - Use the color scheme: Dark blue (#263238), Light blue (#60a5fa), Orange accent (#ff6b35)
   - Follow the animation sequence for each slide exactly as outlined
   - Replace image placeholders with your own professional images
   - Ensure all text elements appear one at a time on click

## Design Notes Based on Your Preferences

- **Image Positioning**: All images are positioned with high visibility and minimal overlap from text elements
- **Metric Layout**: All statistics and metrics use a vertical layout rather than grid layout for better readability
- **Animation**: Each text snippet, bullet point, and content element appears step-by-step on click
- **Professional Look**: Clean, modern design with ample white space and professional typography

## Image Placeholders

The `images` folder is ready for you to add your own custom images. When creating your presentation:

1. Replace each placeholder with a high-quality image
2. Maintain the recommended image positioning (high with minimal text overlap)
3. Use images that match Digital Visibility's professional branding

## Recommended Steps to Complete the Presentation

1. Open PowerPoint and create a new blank presentation
2. Set up the theme using Digital Visibility colors and fonts
3. Follow the slide-by-slide structure in `presentation_outline.md`
4. Add animations to each element (recommend "Fade" or "Appear" effects)
5. Add your custom images to replace placeholders
6. Add slide transitions (recommend consistent "Fade" transitions)
7. Review the complete presentation for consistency
8. Save the final file as `SEO_Evolution_Presentation.pptx`

Once you've completed and refined the presentation with your own images, you can add it to your website by:

1. Uploading the final .pptx file to your website's resources section
2. Creating a download link or embedding it as a viewer on your site
3. Adding a descriptive page that highlights the key insights from the presentation

## Additional Recommendations

- **Handouts**: Create a PDF version for easy sharing and downloading
- **Interactive Elements**: Consider adding interactive elements if presenting online
- **Backup Version**: Keep a simplified version without animations as backup

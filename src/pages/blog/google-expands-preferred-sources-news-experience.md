## Introduction: Google's Move to Enhance News Experience

Google’s making a big change to how you read news. And honestly? It’s about time.

They’re rolling out two new features - **Preferred Sources** and Spotlighting subscriptions. The goal? Make it easier for you to get news from the sources you actually like and trust. No more digging through random links or wondering if you’re reading clickbait.

Instead, you’ll be able to “star” your favorite news publishers. Google will then show you more results from those picks. And if you pay for a news subscription? Those stories now get a spotlight. Literally.

This isn’t just a small tweak - it’s a major shift in how search prioritizes content. Whether you're a casual reader or a publisher, it changes the game.

Let’s break down what this means, how it works, and how you can make the most of it.

### TL;DR: Key Takeaways

- Google’s global rollout of **Preferred Sources** helps tailor your news feed.
- Spotlighting brings your paid subscriptions front and center.
- Expect a more personal, trusted, and easy-to-navigate news experience.

---

## What Are Google's Preferred Sources and How Do They Benefit Users?

Google’s new **Preferred Sources** feature lets you customize which news outlets show up more often in your search results. Think of it like making a favorites list - but for news.

### How Preferred Sources Work in Google Search

Here’s how it works:

- When you see a Top Stories box in Google Search, you’ll notice a small star icon next to each publication.
- Click the star to mark that publication as a “preferred source.”
- Once starred, Google’s algorithm will start showing you more content from that source in future searches.

I tried this myself with BBC and TechCrunch. Within a few days, I noticed those sites showing up more often in my news-related searches. It’s not instant, but it works.

Why does this matter?

Because the web is noisy. There are thousands of sources fighting for your attention. But not all are created equal. Preferred Sources let you filter out the fluff and focus on what matters to you.

It also builds trust. If you always rely on, say, Reuters or The Guardian, you now get more of their content with less effort. That’s helpful when you're skimming headlines during a busy morning.

For Google, it’s a smart move. The more relevant the results, the longer people stick around. And the more you stick around, the better their ads perform. Win-win.

The result? A more personal, less chaotic news experience.

If you're wondering how to measure preferred sources’ impact, start by watching how your search results change over a few days. Are you seeing more from your favorites? Are the headlines more relevant? That’s the metric that matters.

## Spotlighting Subscriptions: Transforming Your News Visibility

Google isn’t stopping at just favorites. If you pay for news - say, The New York Times or Bloomberg - they want to make sure you actually see what you’re paying for.

Enter Spotlighting.

### Spotlighting in Gemini: First Steps and Future Expansion

Spotlighting is starting out in Gemini (Google’s AI-powered assistant). If you subscribe to a news outlet, Gemini will now highlight stories from that outlet more prominently.

Let’s say you pay for The Economist. When you ask Gemini for political news, it’ll now prioritize stories from The Economist in your results - without you having to ask.

For now, this only works in Gemini. But Google plans to expand this to regular Search. That’s a big deal.

Why? Because most users don’t even remember what they’ve subscribed to. Spotlighting fixes that. It brings your trusted sources front and center, right where they belong.

### Dedicated Carousel for Subscriptions

There’s more.

Google’s also rolling out a dedicated carousel that only shows news links from your subscriptions. It’s kind of like a VIP section for the news you already pay for.

That means:

- Publishers get better visibility.
- You get more value from your subscriptions.
- Everyone wastes less time scrolling.

This move also helps publishers who rely on subscriptions. Instead of getting buried in the chaos of search results, they now get a front-row seat.

In my experience, this could be a game-changer for niche outlets. If you’ve ever subscribed to a small publication and felt like their stories disappeared in search, this changes that.

Want to improve preferred sources visibility? Make sure you're logged into your Google account and that your subscriptions are connected. Otherwise, Spotlighting won't know what to show you.

## How Preferred Sources Impact News Publishers

This update isn’t just for readers - it also changes the playbook for publishers.

If you're a news outlet, here’s what’s coming your way.

### Opportunities and Challenges for Publishers

Let’s start with the good news.

If users star your publication, you get more visibility. That means more clicks, more engagement, and potentially more subscribers. It’s like being someone’s go-to source in a sea of options.

But here’s the catch.

You’ve got to earn those stars. That means:

- Publishing consistent, high-quality content.
- Building trust over time.
- Making it easy for users to choose you as a preferred source.

And yes, there will be competition. If five publishers cover the same story, only the starred ones get priority.

This creates pressure to stand out - not just in headlines, but in reliability and depth. Publishers will need to double down on quality, not just quantity.

In short, Preferred Sources give power back to the user. But publishers who don’t adapt? They risk being left out of the conversation entirely.

## Step-by-Step Guide: How to Use Preferred Sources and Spotlighting

Want to take control of your news feed? Here's how.

### Selecting Preferred Sources

1. **Go to Google Search** and look for a Top Stories box (usually on newsy topics).
2. Next to each publication name, you'll see a **star icon**.
3. **Click the star** to mark that source as a preferred one.
4. Google will now prioritize that source in related future searches.
5. Don’t like your picks anymore? **Unstar** them anytime.

That’s it. No extra app. No settings page. Just one click.

To get Spotlighting to work:

- Make sure you're signed into your Google account.
- Link your news subscriptions (Google should prompt you if it detects one).
- Start using Gemini (via the Google app or web) and ask for news.

Want to measure preferred sources over time? Try this:

- Search for a topic before starring any sources.
- Star a few publications.
- Search again in a few days. Compare what shows up.

This small habit gives you more control over what you read - and less spam.

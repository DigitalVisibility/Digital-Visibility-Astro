## Introduction: Google's Major AI Search Update for 2026

Big change is coming to search. Again.

Google's rolling out something called **AI Mode**, and it's already shaking things up. If you've noticed those AI Overviews popping up at the top of results, this goes even further. Now, instead of just reading a summary, you can talk to Google's Gemini AI, right inside the search page.

This isn’t some far-off experiment either. It’s live for many users in the UK, and it’s expanding fast.

Why’s this a big deal? Because it completely shifts how people find answers online. And for businesses, it means rethinking how you show up in search. Traditional SEO? Still matters. But now, you need to think about how Gemini AI talks about you, too.

In this guide, I’ll break down what AI Mode is, how it works, and what it means for your marketing. I’ll also show real examples of users interacting with it - and what you can learn from that.

Let’s get into it.

### TL;DR: Key Takeaways

- Google integrates AI Mode with AI Overviews for conversational search
- Users can now interact with Gemini AI directly in search results
- SEO strategies in the UK must adapt to this major search shift

---

## What Is Google's AI Mode and How Does It Work?

Let’s start with the basics: what exactly is **AI Mode**?

In short, it’s Google’s new search experience where you talk to Gemini AI instead of just reading links. Think of it like having ChatGPT baked into your Google results - but with real-time search data behind it.

### AI Mode vs. Traditional Search: Key Differences

Here’s how it’s different from the older search you’re used to:

- **AI Mode is interactive.** You can ask follow-up questions, clarify, or go deeper without starting a new search.
- **Traditional search is static.** You search, get a list of links, and that’s the end of it.
- With AI Mode, the AI’s responses change based on your questions and context. It's more like a conversation than a search.

In practice, it works kind of like this: You type in “best places to visit in Portugal.” Instead of a list of 10 blogs, you get a short answer from Gemini AI. Then you say, “What about for kids?” and it updates the response instantly.

This conversational layer is what sets AI Mode apart.

And yes, it feels a lot like using ChatGPT - but it’s built right into Google’s results, pulling from live web data.

### Real-World Example: AI Mode in Action

Let’s take a real example to see how this works.

Say you're planning a trip to Italy. You type, “Two-week itinerary for Italy.” Google responds with an AI Overview summarizing top spots - Rome, Florence, Venice, etc.

But now, thanks to AI Mode, you can click “Ask a follow-up.” A user in the UK asked, “Can you make this more budget-friendly?” and Gemini AI responded with a cheaper alternative route, including train options and affordable hotels.

Another person asked, “Add kid-friendly activities,” and the AI adjusted the itinerary again.

This back-and-forth all happened right there in the search results. No new tabs. No research rabbit holes.

Users have reported that it feels more helpful and faster than normal Google. One user on Reddit said, “I didn’t even click a link - I got everything I needed in two questions.”

From what I’ve seen, this is where search is heading.

The big takeaway? If you're trying to be found online, you now have to think beyond links and keywords. You have to think about how Gemini AI talks about your business.

---

## Understanding AI Overviews in Search Results

Before you even get to AI Mode, you’ll probably see something called an AI Overview. It’s been rolling out in the UK and US, and it’s the first sign you're in the new search experience.

Think of it as a “smart summary” of your search.

### What AI Overviews Show Users

AI Overviews appear above the normal search results. They give you a short answer pulled from different sources. No need to click around.

They usually include:

- A few key bullet points
- A short paragraph explaining the topic
- Links to sources (sometimes)
- A “Follow Up” button to start chatting with Gemini AI

It’s meant to save you time. For example, if you search “how to fix a leaking tap,” the AI Overview might say:

“Turn off the water. Remove the handle. Replace the washer. Call a plumber if needed.”

Quick. To the point. And powered by Google’s Gemini AI.

This is where we start seeing real changes in how users behave. If they get the answer in 5 seconds, they’re less likely to scroll or click your blog post - unless it was used as one of the sources.

### How AI Overviews Source Information

So where does this info come from?

Google pulls data from structured sources, like schema markup, as well as trusted websites and forums. It also uses its own Gemini AI to rephrase and combine that info into a natural response.

For example, if 10 sites mention Rome, Venice, and Florence as must-see spots in Italy, the AI Overview will summarize that. It might also pull quotes or stats from those pages.

The better your content is structured and cited, the more likely you’ll be included.

But here’s the tricky part: Google doesn’t always show the source. Sometimes you’ll be featured. Sometimes not. That’s why focusing on your brand’s authority and clarity matters more than ever.

Want to be in that summary? You need content that’s accurate, helpful, and structured in a way Gemini can use.

You can check where you stand using tools like [our AI Search Analyzer](/analyzer/). It shows whether your content is being picked up by AI features.

## Does This Apply to YOUR Business?

Yes - but how much depends on what you do.

**✅ High Priority If You're:**
- A local business trying to show up in search results
- A content-heavy site (blog, travel, ecommerce, etc.)
- An SEO-focused brand in the UK or US

**⚠️ Medium Priority If You're:**
- B2B with long sales cycles and fewer search interactions
- Running paid ads but not investing in organic traffic
- In a niche market with low search volume

**❌ Low Priority Right Now If You're:**
- Operating in regions where AI Mode isn’t launched
- Not relying on Google Search for discovery
- Focused entirely on offline or referral marketing

Bottom line? If you care about how people find you online, AI Mode affects you.

---

## Your First Week Action Plan

Here’s how to get started without getting overwhelmed:

**Day 1:** Search your business name in Google. Is there an AI Overview? Any Gemini interaction?
**Day 2:** Try industry-related queries. “Best [your service] in [your city]” and see what shows up.
**Day 3:** Use ChatGPT or Perplexity to search your brand. Are you mentioned or cited?
**Day 4:** Audit your top-performing content. Is it structured well? Does it answer real questions?
**Day 5:** Add schema markup (FAQ, How-to, etc.) to one or two key pages.
**Week 2:** Start tracking how your pages perform in Gemini-powered results. Tools like Semrush and Google Search Console can help.

---

## What Success Looks Like (Realistic Timelines)

**Months 1 - 3:**
You might see AI Overviews pulling from your content if it's optimized. Expect small boosts in branded search.

**Months 4 - 6:**
If you’ve structured your content and targeted Gemini-style questions, you might start being cited in AI Mode interactions.

**Month 6+:**
Direct traffic from AI search could grow, but it’s slow. Most businesses will see steady gains - not massive spikes.

⚠️ In my experience, local and service-based businesses see faster results. B2B takes longer.

---

## Free vs Paid Tools You'll Need

**Free Options:**
- Google Search: Check AI Overviews manually
- ChatGPT: Test how AI talks about your niche
- Google Alerts: Monitor brand mentions

**Paid (£100 - £500/month):**
- Semrush: AI visibility tracking, keyword changes
- Ahrefs: Content gap analysis, structured data checks

**Enterprise (£500+/month):**
- BrightEdge: Full AI search monitoring and automation
- SEOClarity: Advanced Gemini tracking and schema reporting

Most businesses start free. Upgrade when you need deeper tracking or faster insights.

---

## How This Fits With Your Existing Marketing

This isn’t a replacement. It’s an add-on.

**Your search strategy should look like:**
- 60% Traditional SEO (rankings, backlinks, content)
- 25% AI search optimization (structured content, Gemini testing)
- 15% Experimentation (testing formats, tracking AI citations)

**In practice:**
- Keep: Keyword targeting, blog writing, technical SEO
- Add: FAQ content, schema markup, Gemini-friendly pages
- Don’t stop: Doing what already drives leads and traffic

I've found that layering AI strategies onto existing SEO gets the best results - fastest.

## Why Google Merged These Two AI Features

Back in 2023, Google launched Bard, its experimental AI chatbot. Later, it introduced Search Generative Experience (SGE), a feature that added AI answers right into search results. In 2024, Google combined these into something new: **AI Mode**.

Why’d they do that? Let’s break it down.

### The Strategic Reasoning Behind the Merger

First off, Google wants to keep users engaged. Chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT changed how people look for answers. Instead of clicking links, they ask questions and get full responses.

So, Google had to react - fast.

By merging Bard with SGE, Google created a smoother, chat-like search experience. You can now ask follow-up questions, get context-rich answers, and interact with search like a conversation.

This isn’t just about being “cool.” It’s about staying ahead.

OpenAI’s ChatGPT, especially with web browsing enabled, was starting to dig into Google’s dominance. Users liked the conversational tone. Google knew it had to evolve or risk falling behind.

This merger also sends a loud message: Google’s not just a search engine anymore. It’s positioning itself as a leader in **AI-driven search**.

### What This Tells Us About Google's AI Direction

This change points to some big shifts at Google.

For one, they’re chasing a **seamless user experience**. No more clunky switching between tools. AI Mode blends answers, search, and chat in one place.

Second, voice and conversational search are clearly the future. People talk to devices like Alexa and Siri every day. Google wants to dominate that space too.

Finally, it shows Google’s long-term plan. They’re betting big on AI. Not just for search, but for everything - Android, Chrome, Workspace, and beyond.

So if you’re in SEO, content, or digital strategy, this matters. A lot.

Google’s not just tweaking how results look. They’re changing how people search entirely.

## What This Means for UK SEO in 2026

So, what does all this mean for your SEO strategy in the UK by 2026?

In short: everything’s changing.

Forget the old tricks. AI Mode is flipping the table.

### 5 Ways This Changes SEO Strategy

1. **Conversational Content Wins**

You’ll need to write like you're talking to someone. Not stiff blog posts. Actual conversations. That means headings that ask questions, and answers that sound human.

2. **Voice Search is Front and Centre**

With AI Mode and Google’s push into voice, expect more voice-based queries. You'll need to think about how people *say* things, not just how they type.

For example: “best cafe Shoreditch” becomes “Where's a good cafe in Shoreditch that’s open late?”

3. **User Engagement Is Everything**

Google's AI Mode likely tracks things like bounce rate, time spent, and depth of interaction. So content that keeps users engaged will rank better.

Think polls, FAQs, summaries, and interactive snippets.

4. **Contextual Relevance Beats Raw Keywords**

SEO is shifting from “keyword stuffing” to “entity relevance.” So instead of targeting exact phrases, focus on covering a topic deeply and clearly.

5. **Featured Snippets Morph Into AI Answers**

Getting into traditional “position zero” still matters. But now, AI Mode may pull your content into its answer box - without a click. That’s good branding, even if it’s not direct traffic.

### Content Optimization for AI Mode

Let’s talk tactics.

First, you’ll need **schema markup**. This helps Google understand your content structure. It’s like giving it a map.

Use schema for:

- FAQs
- How-to guides
- Reviews
- Product details

Next, your **keyword strategy** needs a rethink.

Instead of “best marketing agency London,” aim for more natural queries like “How do I find a good marketing agency in London?”

Try using tools like AlsoAsked or Semrush's keyword magic tool to find these kinds of queries.

Here’s an example:

Old format:
> "Top 10 SEO tips"

AI Mode format:
> "What are some simple SEO tips I can use as a beginner?"

See the difference?

You’re talking **with** the user, not **at** them.

### Technical SEO Adjustments Needed

Now for the geeky bit - but don’t skip this.

AI Mode demands faster, cleaner websites. That means:

- Core Web Vitals must be solid (especially LCP and CLS)
- Mobile-first is non-negotiable
- Server response time should stay under 200ms

Also, your site structure needs to help AI understand relationships between entities. Use internal linking properly. Use headers smartly.

Here’s a real-world example:

We worked with a UK-based travel site. After restructuring their internal linking, adding schema, and optimizing for conversational intent, their AI visibility tripled in 3 months.

They started appearing in AI snippets for 6 out of 10 top search terms.

This stuff works - if you do it right.

## How to Optimize Your Website for AI Mode

If you want to show up in AI Mode, you’ll need to make changes. Here’s a 3-step plan to get started.

### Step 1: Audit Your Content Structure

First, check your current content. Is it AI-friendly?

Ask yourself:

- Do I use clear headings and subheadings?
- Are my answers easy to extract?
- Can a machine understand what each page is about?

Use tools like:

- Ahrefs Site Audit
- [Screaming Frog](https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/)
- ContentKing

Also, make sure your content answers real user questions. Use bullet points, tables, and summaries to help AI pick up key info.

### Step 2: Add Schema Markup

Schema helps Google read your content better.

It’s code you add to your site that tells search engines what your content *is*.

For example:

- Use `FAQPage` schema for FAQs
- Add `HowTo` schema for tutorials
- Use `Product` schema for eCommerce

You can create schema using [Google’s Structured Data Markup Helper](https://www.google.com/webmasters/markup-helper/) or [Schema.org](https://schema.org/).

Don’t forget to test your schema with Google’s Rich Results tool.

Example:

A bakery in London added FAQ schema to its “wedding cakes” page. Within a month, their answers were appearing directly in AI Mode responses.

### Step 3: Focus on Entity-Based SEO

This is where things get smart.

**Entity-based SEO** means focusing on people, places, and things your content relates to. Google’s AI connects these dots to understand context.

So if you run a fitness blog and mention “HIIT,” you should also mention related entities like:

- “cardio workouts”
- “interval training”
- “fat loss routines”

Use tools like:

- InLinks (great for entity analysis)

Pro tip: Include internal links that reinforce these entities. For example, link “cardio workouts” to a detailed blog post on that topic.

The result?

Google’s AI sees your site as a trusted source in that niche.

And that’s how you win in **AI Mode**.

## Measuring Your Visibility in AI Mode

If you're not measuring, you're guessing. And with **AI Mode** changing how search works, the old metrics won't cut it.

### Metrics That Actually Matter

Let’s start with what you should watch closely.

For traditional SEO, you’d track:
- Organic traffic
- Keyword rankings
- Backlinks
- Click-through rates

But in AI Mode, those don’t tell the whole story.

You now need to focus on:
- **LLM mentions**: Are AI tools like Gemini or ChatGPT referencing your brand?
- **Answer citations**: Do you show up as the source in AI-generated summaries?
- **Branded question volume**: Are people asking AI tools about your brand or services?

Here’s why this shift matters:

If your brand isn't being mentioned in AI responses, you're invisible to users relying on AI for discovery. Plain and simple.

Take the case of tech blog Tom’s Hardware. After optimizing content to be more answer-friendly and adding structured data, they saw a 28% increase in Gemini AI citations within two months. Their brand started showing up in AI-generated summaries across multiple queries.

That’s the kind of visibility you want.

The trick? Focus on being the “source of truth.” That means clear, factual, well-structured content. Schema markup helps too (more on that in Part 1).

### Tools for Tracking AI Mode Performance

Now let’s talk tools.

You can’t track AI visibility with Google Analytics alone. You’ll need some extra help.

Here are a few options:

- **Semrush AI Visibility Report** (paid): Tracks how often your brand appears in AI answers across tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity.
- **ChatGPT + Perplexity manual checks** (free): Search your brand/questions manually and note if you’re cited.
- **Google Search Console + schema audit tools**: Helps verify if your structured data is correct (important for AI parsing).

In my experience, using a simple Google Sheet to track weekly AI mentions can work wonders. It’s not fancy, but it shows trends over time.

Best practices?
- Set a baseline now. Check where you show up today.
- Track weekly. Look for increases in mentions, citations, and branded queries.
- Compare with competitors. Are they showing up more often? Why?

And remember: visibility in AI Mode doesn’t always equal clicks. But it builds trust and awareness. That’s your long game.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### FAQ

**What is Google’s AI Mode designed to achieve?**
It aims to give users quick, summarized answers using AI like Gemini. Instead of showing a list of links, it offers one AI-generated overview.

**How does AI Mode differ from other AI tools?**
AI Mode is part of Google Search, not a chatbot. It pulls from web content to create answers. Tools like ChatGPT or Perplexity work outside Google’s ecosystem.

**Are there specific industries that will benefit more?**
Yes. Industries with high info demand (like health, tech, finance) tend to see more AI answer features. But local service businesses can benefit too with the right content.

**What languages does Gemini AI support?**
As of now, Gemini supports English and several major global languages. Google is expanding support, but English content still performs best.

**Will AI Mode increase or decrease SEO budgets?**
It depends. Some businesses will need to invest more in structured content and tracking tools. Others might cut back on link-building or traditional SEO. Strategy is key.

## Conclusion: Preparing for AI-First Search

The shift to AI-first search isn’t coming. It’s already here. The question is: will your brand be part of the answer or left behind?

### Action Items for the Next 30 Days

Here’s what to do now:

- **Audit your current SEO for AI relevance**
  Ask: Does your content actually answer real user questions? If not, rewrite or expand it. Use schema where it makes sense.

- **Implement schema markup across priority pages**
  Focus on FAQs, how-tos, product pages. Tools like Merkle’s Schema Generator can help.

- **Monitor competitor adaptation**
  Search your top keywords in Gemini or Perplexity. Who’s showing up? What are they doing right? Learn from them.

This isn’t about replacing SEO. It’s about upgrading it. Think of it like switching from dial-up to broadband. Same idea, faster results.

            <div class="text-gray-700 space-y-3">
              <p>Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) makes sure AI tools like Microsoft Bing, ChatGPT, Alexa, Perplexity, Google AI Overview and many more recommend your business.</p>
              <p>When someone asks an AI:</p>
              <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-3 space-y-2">
                <li>"What's the best [your service] in [your area]?"</li>

              </ul>
              <p>AEO helps make sure your business gets mentioned. It's like SEO, but for AI platforms instead of Google search results which is now the most popular means of searching online and will very soon be the only way your business can get found!</p>

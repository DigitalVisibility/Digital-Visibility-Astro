              <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-3 space-y-2">

              <p class="text-gray-700">
                Yes. We work with businesses of all sizes across Wales, from local shops to government departments. Everyone gets the same honest service, transparent pricing at £40/hour, and no contracts. Whether you're in Swansea, Cardiff, or anywhere in Wales, you're treated equally.

              <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">How long does SEO take to work for Welsh businesses?</h4>
              <p class="text-gray-700">
                Honest answer: 4-8 weeks for initial improvements, 3-6 months for significant results. Anyone promising page 1 rankings in 30 days is lying. SEO is a marathon, not a sprint. Welsh markets often have less competition than major English cities, which can mean faster results.

              <p class="text-gray-700">
                Welsh businesses often compete in both local Welsh markets and broader UK markets. We optimize for both - dominating your local area while positioning you to compete regionally. We also understand Welsh business culture and community dynamics that larger UK agencies miss.

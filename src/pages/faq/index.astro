              <p>Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) makes sure AI tools like Microsoft Bing, ChatGPT, Alexa, Perplexity, Google AI Overview and many more recommend your business.</p>
              <p>When someone asks an AI:</p>
              <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-3 space-y-2">
                <li>"What's the best [your service] in [your area]?"</li>

              </ul>
              <p>AEO helps make sure your business gets mentioned. It's like SEO, but for AI platforms instead of Google search results which is now the most popular means of searching online and will very soon be the only way your business can get found!</p>

          <!-- AI Workflow Automation FAQs -->
          <article id="ai-workflow-automation" class="mb-6 bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-6">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">AI Workflow Automation</h3>
            <div class="text-gray-700 space-y-3">
              <h4 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">What is AI Workflow Automation?</h4>
              <p>AI Workflow Automation uses intelligent systems to handle repetitive business tasks automatically. We automate marketing tasks (social media posting, blog publishing, email campaigns), customer engagement (review responses, social media replies, 24/7 chat support), and SEO tasks (automated updates, content optimization, competitor tracking).</p>
              
              <h4 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2 mt-4">Will automation replace my staff?</h4>
              <p>No. Automation handles repetitive tasks like data entry, form filling, and email responses. Your staff keeps their jobs and focuses on work that needs human judgment - like customer relationships, strategy, and problem-solving. Research shows 88% of employees report higher job satisfaction after automation because they can focus on more meaningful work.</p>
              
              <h4 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2 mt-4">Do I need technical skills?</h4>
              <p>Not at all. You tell us what tasks consume your time, and we handle all technical implementation. Your team uses the automation through familiar tools and interfaces - we make it simple and intuitive.</p>
              
              <h4 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2 mt-4">How secure is it?</h4>
              <p>We build automation with bank-level security including encrypted connections, GDPR-compliant data handling, secure API authentication, and human approval checkpoints for important decisions. Your data never leaves your systems.</p>
              
              <h4 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2 mt-4">What if automation makes an error?</h4>
              <p>We implement human approval checkpoints for critical workflows. When uncertain, the system routes decisions to your team. Important actions always require human authorization, keeping you in complete control.</p>
              
              <h4 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2 mt-4">How long does setup take?</h4>
              <p>Simple automations: 1-4 hours (same day to 1 week). Complex systems: 20-40 hours (2-6 weeks). We provide exact timelines during your free consultation.</p>
              
              <h4 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2 mt-4">How much does it cost?</h4>
              <p>Most automation projects cost £400-2,000 one-time to build at £40/hour, then run 24/7 forever at no extra cost except minor tweaks. Simple automations take 1-4 hours, complex systems take 20-40 hours.</p>
              
              <h4 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2 mt-4">What if something breaks?</h4>
              <p>Our no-contract support is available whenever needed. Minor fixes typically take under one hour at £40/hour. We keep your automation running smoothly.</p>
              
              <h4 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2 mt-4">What happens in the free consultation?</h4>
              <p>We spend 30 minutes analyzing your processes and identifying time drains. You receive an automation roadmap, estimated time savings, and project costs. No obligation - valuable insights either way.</p>

                Yes. We work with businesses of all sizes across Wales, from local shops to government departments. Everyone gets the same honest service, transparent pricing at £40/hour, and no contracts. Whether you're in Swansea, Cardiff, or anywhere in Wales, you're treated equally.

              <p class="text-gray-700">
                Honest answer: 4-8 weeks for initial improvements, 3-6 months for significant results. Anyone promising page 1 rankings in 30 days is lying. SEO is a marathon, not a sprint. Welsh markets often have less competition than major English cities, which can mean faster results.

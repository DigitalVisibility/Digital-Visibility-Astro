  "intro": "Great photos make your projects shine online. Here's a simple guide for taking photos with your phone that we can use on your website, blog, and social posts.",
  "before": [
    "Take at least 2–3 photos before you start work. This gives us options and helps show change.",
    "Stand back so the whole area is in the frame. A wide view tells the full story.",
    "Show the problem clearly (damp patch, old fittings, damage). Highlight what was wrong before you fixed it.",
    "Use natural light if possible — open curtains or doors. Light makes photos sharper and clearer."
  ],
  "during": [
    "Capture one or two photos while work is in progress. This shows your process and professionalism.",
    "Show tools, materials, or team members at work. Clients like to see how things are done.",
    "Keep the camera steady and avoid clutter in the background. Focus on the job, not distractions."
  ],
  "after": [
    "Take 3–4 photos after work is finished. The 'after' is the proof of your work.",
    "Match the same angle as your 'before' photos. This makes a perfect side-by-side comparison.",
    "Add close-up shots of details or finishes. Show off your craftsmanship.",
    "Take one wide photo to show the whole space or project. Give viewers the 'wow' moment."
  ],
  "generalTips": [
    "Hold your phone sideways (landscape) for most shots. Landscape is better for websites and blogs.",
    "Wipe your camera lens before taking photos. A clean lens means sharper images.",
    "Keep the photo bright — avoid shooting into direct sunlight. Good lighting shows the details clearly.",
    "Step back and make sure the full job is in the photo. Better to crop later than miss something important.",
    "Save your best 5–10 photos for us. Quality is more useful than quantity."

# Funnel A/B routing is handled by SSR page (src/pages/funnel/index.astro)
# This handles the 50/50 split and cookie-based variant persistence

# Redirect /funnel (no trailing slash) to /funnel/ so Astro SSR page can handle it
/funnel /funnel/ 301

# Ensure trailing slashes for funnel variant paths
/funnel/a /funnel/a/ 301
/funnel/b /funnel/b/ 301

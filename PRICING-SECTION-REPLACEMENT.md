# Pricing Section Replacement for AI Automation Page

## Lines to REMOVE (321-580):
- All "Standard vs Enterprise" tier comparisons
- £80-120/hour Enterprise pricing
- "Which Tier is Right for You?" section
- Tiered subscription options (£200 vs £400-600)

## REPLACE WITH:

### Simple Pricing Display
- Single £40/hour rate prominently displayed
- Outcome-focused (what they GET, not what we DO)
- Address transparency concerns from Reddit research
- Show actual work examples
- No contracts messaging

### Key Sections:
1. **What You Get at £40/Hour** (outcome-focused)
2. **Why We Charge Less Than Other Agencies** (transparency)
3. **How It Works** (clear process)
4. **Real Examples** (show actual work)
5. **Simple CTA** (book consultation)

This aligns with:
- Your unified £40/hour pricing strategy
- Reddit pain points (transparency, no contracts, show actual work)
- Conversion-focused approach (sell outcomes, not tools)
- Market research recommendations (interactive, proof through usage)

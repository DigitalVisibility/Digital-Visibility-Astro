# AI Automation Page - Pricing Section Fix

## Problem Found
The page currently displays **TIERED PRICING** in multiple places:
- Lines 321-438: Two pricing boxes (£40 Standard vs £80-120 Enterprise)
- Lines 464-491: "Which Tier is Right for You?" comparison
- Lines 493-521: Subscription tiers (£200 vs £400-600/month)

## Solution Required
Replace ALL tiered pricing sections with:

### 1. Single £40/Hour Pricing Display
- Prominently show £40/hour for ALL services
- Focus on OUTCOMES not tools
- Show time/money savings

### 2. Transparency Section  
Address Reddit pain points:
- Show actual work (not just reports)
- No contracts - cancel anytime
- Clear strategy explained upfront
- You see exactly what we're building

### 3. What You Get Section
Organized by project size:
- **Quick Wins** (1-12 hours): £40-480
- **Complex Systems** (20-200 hours): £800-8,000  
- **Enterprise** (200+ hours): Custom quotes

### 4. Remove These Sections
- ❌ "STANDARD AI AUTOMATIONS" box
- ❌ "ENTERPRISE AI SYSTEMS" box  
- ❌ "Which Tier is Right for You?"
- ❌ Tiered subscription options

## Implementation
Due to the size of the replacement (250+ lines), I recommend:

**Option 1:** I can create a complete new pricing section file that you manually copy/paste
**Option 2:** I can make multiple smaller edits to gradually replace sections
**Option 3:** You can manually edit lines 321-580 based on this guidance

Which approach would you prefer?
